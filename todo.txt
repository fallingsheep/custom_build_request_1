INFISTAR STUFF
In AHConfig.sqf add 88890 to allowed dialogs:
_ALLOWED_Dialogs = [-1,106, ... ,88890];

adding "#USER:_keyMenu" in the ALLOWED CMDMenus list (_cMenu=) as cen said is all you need to make this work properly :)

Delete this from AH.sqf:
lbsetpicture='no';
Also delete lbsetpicture from the functions restored check (_FRC):
'lbsetpicture',

1. In AHConfig.sqf add 55510 to allowed dialogs:
Code (Text):
_ALLOWED_Dialogs = [-1,106, ... ,55510];
2. In AH.sqf find and delete these statements:
playableUnits = [player]; (two occurrences)
lbsetpicture='no';
lbSetData='no';
createMarkerLocal='no';
setMarkerTextLocal='no';
setMarkerTypeLocal='no';
setMarkerColorLocal='no';

Find and delete these from the FNCRestored check (_FRC):
'lbsetpicture',
'lbSetData',
'createMarkerLocal',
'setMarkerTextLocal',
'setMarkerTypeLocal',
'setMarkerColorLocal',

3. In AH.sqf find this line:
Code (Text):
        admin_fnc_esp = {
Add this directly above it:
#include "dzgmAdminESPicons.sqf"

Then put the dzgmAdminESPicons.sqf file in your dayz_server\init folder. Note these limitations of the above ESP.

4. In AHconfig.sqf set _CUF = false; Note this is temporary until the final OA patch is released which fixes the CU RE exploit.
